CIND820 Capstone Project
Abstract
The pandemic has made the human population stay at home longer which has opened the number of available hours to them to use and consume. One activity that has been accessible is the internet and the usage has increased over time due to the lack of alternative activities and the choice to participate and be stimulated by the offerings of the Internet. From Statistics Canada - Almost half of Canadians (48%) streamed video content, such as Netflix, Crave, news, concerts or fitness videos, more often since the start of the pandemic. New York Times reported 15-17% increase in Netflix and YouTube usage and Forbes states there has been a increase of 12%. 
With this trend, there is a place where people will want access to items, products, videos faster and tailored to them. The system that takes this space is called the Recommender systems which has been prevalent these days and avoidable in our daily journey. My project will focus on developing a recommender system which will help individuals retrieve content based on their interests through algorithms that will create choices and customized lists based on that user
